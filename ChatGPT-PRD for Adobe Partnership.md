Happy to continue iterating!

## Prompt:
Looks good, any questions you have for me that could make this PRD better?

## Response:
Great ‚Äî the PRD is strong for a v1. That said, here are a few thoughtful questions that, if answered, could improve clarity, make handoff easier for developers/agents, and future-proof the project a bit:

* * *

### üß© Clarification & Expansion Questions

#### 1\. **Tone and Visual Style**

*   Do you want the tone to be more corporate (Accenture-style) or more innovative/startup (e.g., Notion-style, clean and modern)?
*   Should we include your personal photo or branding anywhere (e.g., a founder blurb or logo)?

#### 2\. **Logo, Icons, and Fonts**

*   Do you already have a logo or a specific font family (e.g., Adobe Clean, Inter, etc.) you‚Äôd like to use?
*   Should the site use Adobe‚Äôs visual branding elements (e.g., subtle nods to their red, gradients, iconography)?

#### 3\. **Future-Proofing**

*   Would you like a hidden or commented-out ‚ÄúComing Soon‚Äù section for potential future blog posts, portfolio, or contact form?
*   Do you want any kind of GitHub badge or CTA to contribute to the open source repo (even if the repo is private for now)?

#### 4\. **Domain Setup**

*   Will this live on `experiencereinvented.com` root or a subdomain (e.g., `research.experiencereinvented.com`)? Knowing this helps set up canonical URLs and SEO tags correctly.

#### 5\. **Adobe Relations**

*   Do you want to name-drop any specific Adobe programs (e.g., ‚ÄúPartner Exchange,‚Äù ‚ÄúAdobe Developer Console,‚Äù ‚ÄúAdobe I/O‚Äù) to build credibility?
*   Should we explicitly state that the site is requesting access to partner SDKs, or keep that more implicit?

#### 6\. **Licensing / Legal**

*   Should we display a disclaimer that this site is not affiliated with Adobe Inc., for legal clarity?
*   Do you want a footer note about how you‚Äôre respecting all licensing terms of Adobe‚Äôs SDKs and APIs?

#### 7\. **AI Stack / Tech Interests**

*   Do you want to call out specific AI technologies you‚Äôre exploring (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude, Vertex AI, etc.) or keep that general?
*   Should we mention your AI design agent or MCP setup as part of what you‚Äôre testing?

* * *

Let me know which of these you'd like to include and I can update the Canvas PRD accordingly.

## Prompt:
1. Innovation / Start up, clean and modern, no logo or branding or personal
2. Nope, maybe whatefver font adobe.com uses. We should add in some adobe (as with the grandiant it has the adobe red, however we shouldn't use it directly)
3. No coming soon yet, just need to not get in trouble with work and have a partnership site for a license, stress on no plan to acquire customers or do any work yet. Nope, not yet
4. root domain and www, not research, mainly www
5. Nope not yet, keep anon, yes to requesting AEMaaCS SDK to do research
6. Yes mention adobe, and also mention it does not seek to compete against any existing Adobe Partners at this time
7. Keep it high level
